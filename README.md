# Rolling-Ball

This is a very simple but playable game to use many of the basic concepts from the beginner tutorial modules. We will be making a roll-a-ball game where we will collect special game objects. We will see how to create new game objects,add components to these game objects, set the values on their properties and position these game objects in the scene to create a game. In our game the player will control a ball rolling around the game board. We will move the ball using physics and forces. We will look at the input from the player through the keyboard and we'll use those inputs to apply forces to the ball, making it move in our scene. We will see how to detect contact between the player's ball and the pick-up game objects, and use these events to collect these pick-up game objects. We displays the current count and ends the game when 5 of the game objects have been picked up.
